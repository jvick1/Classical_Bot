# Classical Music Playlist Generator
This project is a curated collection of classical music tracks tailored to various thematic playlists, such as *18th Century Club Bangers, Villain Vibes from the 19th Century,* and *seasonal compilations like Winter Wonderland* and *Autumn Reflections*. The repository includes detailed information about each song's artist, title, and duration, along with pre-made playlists designed to fit specific moods, events, and historical contexts.

# Key Features
## Song Database:
A CSV file listing classical pieces with artist names, track titles, and durations in seconds. **This needs to be finalized**

## Playlists:
"Playlist to Woo an 1800s Romantic"
"18th Century Gambling Den Soundtrack"
"Classical Gym Playlist: 1800s Edition"
And many more!

## Versatility:
The playlists include tracks from iconic composers like Beethoven, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, and Mozart, making them perfect for study sessions, workout vibes, or historical reenactments.

## Customization:
For these playlists I used ChatGPT to create the playlist based on artist, time period, mood, etc.

Once we have the finalized counts we can review to see if we can make additional playlist or add new songs besides classical songs. 

# Goals
Create at least 52 videos to release one a week. Get monitized on YouTube with this cool bot idea!
